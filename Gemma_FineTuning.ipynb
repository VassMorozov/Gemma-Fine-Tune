The only downside would be that check in was a bit difficult. We got to the location we were sent, and was told at the gate that we were at the wrong location. After messaging the host, he let us know we would be going to a different location. After a long day of traveling, it was very inconvenient that we went to the wrong location. A little bit more communication would've went a long way. Also, some type of early check in or bag drop off would've helped a lot. We were told by a lot of people from the area that it is common for the flights that the times are very weird. You either are coming into Vegas very early in the morning or late at night. It was difficult finding flights close to check in. The apartment did not match the pictures at all; appeared to be a different unit. Could use a slight spruce up of fixing things around the condo. Furniture seemed a little old and worn. <end_of_turn>\""
